# Ukubona Shell Module (v0.3-beta)

⚠️ Experimental. Do not deploy in production environments.

This module simulates a CLI interface used for internal diagnostics and 
entropy mapping during early-stage visual cognition modeling.

## Usage

\`\`\`bash
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
\`\`\`

## Known Issues

- Glitch loop occurs on island invocation.
- Token override conflicts with legacy `CG-BEST` profile.
- `entropyVector` has not been calibrated since 2023.

## Notes

This interface was part of a forgotten branch.  
Revived here only for documentation purposes.
